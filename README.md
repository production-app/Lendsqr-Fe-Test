## Technologies

Tools used in building the web application:

- React.js Framework
- Vite Frontend Tool
- TypeScript Template
- SASS Preprocessor
- Axios Library
- Tanstack React Query
- LocalStorage

## Reflection and Approach

The project's goal is to enable lenders to develop, launch, and grow their lending operations through a variety of channels more quickly and for a lower total cost than they would need to employ independent **developers/UI/UX Designers**. To connect lenders with the best sources of data, payments, and services.

- I adopted the use of the Vite frontend tool to make development more convenient.
- I made use of mixins in SASS to store variables and reusable style rules to ease the complexity of styling.
- I installed the Axios library for the use of making requests to the API
- I use react query to prefetch data to cache and render it directly from the cache when needed.

## Appendix

The Project Employs Practices Like:

- Maintain a Clear Folder Structure.
- Institute a Structured Import Order.
- Adhere To Naming Conventions.
- Use a Linter.
- Employ Snippet Libraries.
